Usage: berdecode [-s|-strip <bytestostrip>] [-d|-debug]
        [-T|-table <tablefilename] {<filename>|-}

This is berdecode, revision 1.10 as of 1997/06/24.
This program reads a binary ASN.1 grammar file generated by snacc -T
and uses it to decode ASN.1 BER encoded data from files or stdin.

From every message the first <bytestostrip> bytes (default 2)
are skipped.

Flag -d gives additional information during decoding.
